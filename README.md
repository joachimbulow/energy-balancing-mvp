# pem-energy-balance
This repository proposes a technology stack that should theoretically be able to aid in supporting the danish electrical infrastructure through a series of batteries communicating to charge / discharge power into the grid

Battery-sim
Highly concurrent simulations of batteries running in the ultra-fast golang runtime

Coordination
Kafka highly distributed fault-tolerant message broker feeding millinos of messages to a digestion pipeline (TBD in terms of tech)

Vizualisation
TBD, real-time vizualisation
